\section{Introduction}
Traffic Analysis (TA) is a well studied technique that breaches data confidentiality over Internet, typically targeting protocols including HTTPS\cite{rfc2818} and SSL\cite{rfc6101}/TLS\cite{rfc5246}. This type of attacks works by correlating the encrypted contents to side channel information frequently omitted by cryptographic scheme designs, such as packet length, timing and any other unprotected meta data. Consequently, TA is often associated to Internet privacy violation and Mass Surveillance.
