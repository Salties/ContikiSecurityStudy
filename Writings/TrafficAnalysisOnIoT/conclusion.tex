\section{Conclusion \label{conclusion}}

In this paper, after reporting an implementation issue of 802.15.4 Security in Contiki, we presented two attacks those proved the concept of practicability of applying Traffic Analysis techniques over IoT applications. The first attack demonstrates that content of encrypted ICMP messages could be leak through the packets length and MAC destination. The second attack exploits the difference in time of processing a PING request to distinguish different IoT devices.
