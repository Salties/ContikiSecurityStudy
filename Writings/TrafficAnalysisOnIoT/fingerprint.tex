\section{Code Fingerprinting}
\Cref{PingDevice} reported the existence of outliers in the PRIs. A common cause of the outliers is that the PING response has been delayed by other tasks occupied the CPU when the request is received. 

Our study shows that such outlier data can be exploited to fingerprint a specific device running a specific application.
