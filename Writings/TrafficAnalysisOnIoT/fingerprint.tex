\section{Node Fingerprint} \label{Pingload}

One phenomenon we observed in \Cref{802154SecPRI} and \Cref{PRIs} is that certain outliers exists in the data. Considering the fact that there is hardly any branches in the PING requests processing, a typical cause of the outliers would be that PING processing being pre-empted by other tasks executing on the node.  \Cref{PingloadExample} illustrates an example of PRI being delayed by sensor reading .
