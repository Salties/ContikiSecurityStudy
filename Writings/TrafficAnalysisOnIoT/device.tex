\section{Distinguish Devices}
IoT applications utilise a great variation of devices, with each having different processing power. This implies that the processing time of some specific packets can be exploited as a hint to the model of device. 

PING is therefore an ideal feature supported in 6LoWPAN that can be exploited to perform such an attack due to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item PING is processed in a standardised routine where nearly no computation is required, minimising the noise in the data.
	\item The support of PING is required by the standard\cite{rfc4443}, making the attack universally applicable.
\end{enumerate}
