\section{Introduction}

In this paper we aim to explain a failed RNG implementation for IoT devices.

\subsection{Contribution}
In this paper we focus on two topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Revised the fact that why using a 16 bit LFSR as PRNG is a bad idea.
\item Demonstrated a method to bias the RNG seed on an IoT device.
\end{itemize}
