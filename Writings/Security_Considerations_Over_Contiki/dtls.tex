\chapter{DTLS} \label{Chp: DTLS}

In this chapter we analyse DTLS on Contiki. We consider only two ciphersuites those have been implemented by the tinydtls implementation, which are TLS\_PSK\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8 and TLS\_ECDHE\_ECDSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8. 

One thing to be noticed is that both ciphersuites uses AES-128 CCM for data encryption and therefore they only behave different during handshake. Hence we do not distinguish application data encrypted by both ciphersuites.

\section{Protocol and Implementation}

Due to the fact that tinydlts implemented only a minimum features of DTLS and supports only two ciphersuites, TLS\_PSK\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8 and TLS\_ECDHE\_ECDSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8, we have found no applicable attacks from \cite{rfc7457}.

\section{Packet Size}

Since application data are encrypted using AES-128 CCM, its size is not hidden and is visible in the header, as highlighted in the middle of \Cref{Fig: Size of application data in DTLS}.

\begin{figure*}[ht!]

	\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{fig/dtlslength.png}
	\caption{Size of application data in DTLS}
	\label{Fig: Size of application data in DTLS}
\end{figure*}

Referring to \cite{rfc5116}, the size of application data is exactly the value of the highlighted Length in \Cref{Fig: Size of application data in DTLS} minus $16$ bytes.

\section{Timing}

In this section, we analyse the availability of timing information when the application data is protected by DTLS using the tinydtls implementation on Contiki.

\subsection{Processing Model}

The procedure of a Session with DTLS is as depicted by \Cref{Fig: A Session with DTLS}.

\begin{figure*}[ht!]
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig/dtls_session.png}
	\caption{A Session with DTLS}
	\label{Fig: A Session with DTLS}
\end{figure*}

DTLS provides protection between only two Sensor Nodes in the network; thus the source and destination are consistent within a DTLS session. The 6LoWPAN encapsulation and decapsulation procedure are hence identical for all packets using the same DTLS session; therefore the time length of 6LoWPAN decapsulation and encapsulation in \Cref{Fig: A Session with DTLS} are considered to be constant.

Therefore in this section we put our interest in the timing of DTLS decryption/encryption and the execution time of application code.

\subsection{AES Timing} \label{tinydtls AES Timing}

tinydtls uses the OpenBSD optimised AES implementation. Its source code is available at:\\ 
\url{https://github.com/Salties/MyRepository/blob/master/tinydtls-0.8.2/aes/rijndael.c}

We applied the same tests as described in \Cref{Sec: AES Timing}. 

The average AES execution time is shown in \Cref{Tbl: tinydtls AES execution time estimation}.

\begin{table}[ht!]
	\center
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		                        & CC2538 SW \\ \hline
		50 executions           & 160.07          \\ \hline
		100 executions          & 320.06          \\ \hline
		150 executions          & 480.05          \\ \hline
		200 executions          & 640.13          \\ \hline
		Ticks per executions    & 3.20            \\ \hline
		AES Execution Time (ms) & 0.098           \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{tinydtls AES execution time estimation}
	\label{Tbl: tinydtls AES execution time estimation}
\end{table}

The result of Fixed vs Random test is shown in \Cref{Tbl: Fixed vs Random test result for tinydtls AES execution time on CC2538}

\begin{table}[ht!]
	\center
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		                         & Fixed       & Random      \\ \hline
		Sample Mean              & 640.28      & 640.25      \\ \hline
		Sample Standard Deviation & 0.49        & 0.53        \\ \hline
		t-score                  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{1.32} \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Fixed vs Random test result for tinydtls optimised AES execution time on CC2538. Executions per sample: $200$. Sample size: $1000$.}
	\label{Tbl: Fixed vs Random test result for tinydtls AES execution time on CC2538}
\end{table}

Applying the TVLA t-score threshold which is $4.5$, the results in \Cref{Tbl: Fixed vs Random test result for tinydtls AES execution time on CC2538} imply that the tinydtls optimised AES implementation has passed our test, i.e. no leakage is detected through the execution time of the tinydtls optimised AES implementation. 

The result is consistent with our expectation, as the implementation has no branch\footnote{The only branch in the source code is for AES-192 and AES-256, which are not used in the ciphersuites.} in the source code and is done with only statements of assignment, shift and XORs. The low sample standard deviation is also an evidence that supports our expectation that the AES implementation takes a nearly constant time.

\subsection{Protocol Suite Processing Timing}

The observable response time in \Cref{Fig: A Session with DTLS}, , denotes as $t_R$, can be divided into two parts:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Protocol suite processing time $t_P$. This part consists of the 6LoWPAN decapsulation / encapsulation and DTLS decryption / encryption in \Cref{Fig: A Session with DTLS}. $t_P$ is independent to the application. 
	\item Application code execution time $t_A$. It is one of the most interested information to the Adversary that could be exploited to learn information about the application data.
\end{enumerate}

Apparently we have
\begin{equation}
t_R = t_P + t_A
\end{equation}

One way to extract $t_A$ is to compute it by 
\begin{equation} \label{Eq: t_A}
t_A = t_R - t_P
\end{equation}

Practically, given a specific platform the value of $t_P$ is predictable, as it is independent to the upper layer application and the choices of different DTLS session key does not affect the timing as shown in \Cref{tinydtls AES Timing}. 

We estimated $t_P$ on CC2538 by an application where the Sensor Node replies to any Requests with a constant predefined value. A hint of the source code is shown in \Cref{nullapp}.

\lstinputlisting[label={nullapp}, captionpos=b, caption={Application code with negligible execution time}]{src/nullapp.c} 

Since no effective application code exists in this application, its $t_A$ can be considered negligible; hence the $t_R$ can be viewed as an approximation of $t_P$.

Avoid exceeding 802.15.4 MTU, the length of DTLS Payload can be ranged from $1$ byte to $47$ bytes. However in our setup, the Requests are forwarded by an Border Router and thus one byte is taken by the decompressed Hop Limit in IPv6 Header; therefore the the length of DTLS Payload in our Requests is ranged from $1$ byte to $46$ bytes.

\Cref{Fig: Example histograms of protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS} shows two example histograms of part of our result. We denote $|Req|$ and $|Res|$ as the length in bytes of the DTLS Payload in Requests and Responses respectively.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

	\begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}

	\caption{Example histograms of protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS}
	\label{Fig: Example histograms of protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS}
\end{figure}

Similar to the ECHO response time,$t_R$ in the samples also appeared to densely clustered near a specific value while a few are drifted away; hence we use the sample median to characterise $t_R$ in our experiments. Medians of the examples in \Cref{Fig: Example histograms of protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS} are summarised in \Cref{Tbl: Median of response times in examples}. It is clear that when $|Req|$ and $|Res|$ are at their maximum value, $t_R$ is significantly longer comparing to $Req$ and $Res$ at their minimum value.
 
\begin{table}
	\center
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		 				&($|Req| = 1$, $|Res| = 1$) 	& ($|Req| = 46$, $|Res| = 47$) 	\\ \hline
		 Sample Median	&79.712 ms                  			& 132.740 ms                   			\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}

	\caption{Medians of response time in the examples of \Cref{Fig: Example histograms of protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS}}
	\label{Tbl: Median of response times in examples}
\end{table}

We measured $t_R$ with different combinations of $|Req|$ and $|Res|$. The results are shown in \Cref{Fig: Protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\center
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/dtlstime_fixed_req.png}
	\subcaption{Response time($t_R$) with $|Req| \in \{1, 23, 46\}$}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/dtlstime_fixed_res.png}
	\subcaption{Response time($t_R$) with $|Res| \in \{1, 23, 46\}$}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS}
	\label{Fig: Protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS}
\end{figure}

The results in \Cref{Fig: Protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS} suggest that $|Req|$ and $|Res|$ might both be linear to the $t_R$ on CC2538. Assume $t_R$ is in the form of:
\begin{equation}
	t_R = b_0 + b_1|Req| + b_2|Res|
\end{equation}

Applying multiple linear regression using least squares fit, we have an estimation of $t_R$ (in ms) for CC2538:

\begin{equation}
	t_R = 78.388 + 0.538|Req| + 0.638|Res|
	\label{Eq: t_R estimation}
\end{equation}

The $R^2$ for the extimation of \Cref{Eq: t_R estimation} is $0.9997$, which is consistent to our intuition of \Cref{Fig: Protocol suite processing time on CC2538 with DTLS} that $|Req|$ and $|Res|$ are strongly linear related to $t_R$ on the platform.

Since $t_A$ in this application is negligible, we can therefore approximate $t_P$ by $t_R$ for CC2538:
\begin{equation} \label{Eq: CC2538tP}
	t_P \approx t_R = 78.388 + 0.538|Req| + 0.638|Res|
\end{equation}

The estimation of $t_P$ can be used as a profile to estimate $t_A$ in an attack where the Adversary attempts to recover the execution time of application code on CC2538.

\subsection{Application Code Timing}

Given the knowledge of the protocol suite processing time for a specific platform, $t_P$, the application code execution time, $t_A$, can therefore be estimated by subtracting $t_P$ from the observable response time, $t_R$, by \Cref{Eq: t_A}.

To test this method, we used an application that repeatedly invokes the Contiki system random number generator according to the data in the Request, and replies the execution time as the Response.

The code is hinted by \Cref{apptime}.

\lstinputlisting[label={apptime}, captionpos=b, caption={Code for application code timing}]{src/dtlsapptime.c} 

We tested the \Cref{Eq: t_A} with \Cref{apptime} on CC2538 with different values of $t_A$, using $t_P$ estimation given by \Cref{Eq: CC2538tP}.

The result for  low $t_A$ ($<1.5$ ms) is shown in \Cref{Fig: Estimation for low tA}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\center
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/lowtaest.png}
	\subcaption{Estimation of values of $t_A$}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/lowabstaerr.png}
	\subcaption{Absolute approximation error of $t_A$ estimation}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/lowrtvtaerr.png}
	\subcaption{Relative approximation error of $t_A$ estimation}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Estimation for low $t_A$($<1.5$ms) on CC2538}
	\label{Fig: Estimation for low tA}
\end{figure}

The result indicates that the estimation totally failed at low $t_A$, such that negative execution time is estimated. We consider this is caused by the fact that at such level the execution time is dominated by the systematic noise. The absolute approximation error increases almost linearly, whilst the relative approximation error decreases inverse proportionally.

%DTLS has potentially the best interoperability as it is an variation of the widely used TLS in Internet. However, its design might not fit into the nature of WSN for practical reasons.
%
%\section{Implementation Issues}
%The most practical implementation we found on Contiki OS so far is tinydtls.
%
%tinydtls\cite{tinydtls} currently supports two ciphersuites, namely TLS\_PSK\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8 and TLS\_ECDHE\_ECDSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8. 
%
%However, we encountered several difficulties when trying to set up an encrypted network using tinydtls.
%
%\begin{description}
%\item[Low Computational Power] \hfill \\
%Curve computation requires relatively a large amount of computational power. Even using a relatively powerful platform (CC2538), it still takes minutes to complete a DTLS handshake with
%TLS\_ECDHE\_ECDSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8.
%
%\item[Low Bandwidth] \hfill \\
%The 6LowPAN standard specifies that the minimum MTU is 127 bytes whilst 67 (87 with LLSEC) bytes are occupied by protocol headers until UDP, which leaves 60 (40 with LLSEC) bytes available for UDP layer payload. This value has been exceeded by several handshake packets even with pre-shared keys. Doing key exchange or even using longer keys only makes this problem worse. Some attempts have been made to solve this issue, e.g. CoDTLS\cite{CoDTLS}\footnote{This draft has been abandoned for some reason we do not know.}. As a result, DTLS is only available on those devices support extra frame length than 6LowPAN requirements.
%
%\item[Code Size] \hfill \\
%The tinydtls fails to fit into some devices, e.g. skymote, as its size of code is too large.
%\end{description}
%
%Therefore although TLS\_PSK\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8 is less flexible (and probably less secure) as it uses a pre-shared master secret, it is still considered to be a relatively practical security measure as it requires less resources.
%
%\section{No Multicast Support}
%Some application protocols, such as CoAP, utilises the multicast feature of 6LowPAN whilst TLS is a protocol designated for securing communications between two parties, so is DTLS. To  our knowledge, DTLS does not make any attempt to support multicasting.
%
%\section{Overloading DTLS with LLSEC}
%Adopting both security measures at the same time is possible as they are implemented at different layers. However, it is questionable whether this will bring more security, as both {\it noncoresec} and TLS\_PSK\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8 are using 128 bit AES with CCM mode as their cryptographic primitive.
