ABSTRACT = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a recently developed energy-efficient short-range wireless communication protocol. In this paper, we discuss and compare the maximum peer-to-peer throughput, the minimum frame turnaround time, and the energy consumption for three protocols, namely BLE, IEEE 802.15.4 and SimpliciTI. The specifics and the main contributions are the results both of the theoretical analysis and of the empirical measurements, which were executed using the commercially available hardware transceivers and software stacks. The presented results reveal the protocols’ capabilities and enable one to estimate the feasibility of using these technologies for particular applications. Based on the presented results, we draw conclusions regarding the feasibility and the most suitable application scenarios of the BLE technology.},

Such IP-based systems are foreseen to be used for building and lighting automation systems where devices interconnect with each other, forming, for example, low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). Both multicast and its security are key needs in these networks. This draft presents a method for securing IPv6 multicast communication based on the DTLS which is already supported for unicast communication for CoAP devices. This draft deals with the adaptation of the DTLS record layer to protect multicast group communication, assuming that all group members already have the group security association parameters in their possession. The adapted DTLS record layer provides message confidentiality, integrity and replay protection to group messages using the group keying material before sending the message via IPv6 multicast to the group.},

    abstract =    {CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks. Basic CoAP messages work well for the small payloads we expect from temperature sensors, light switches, and similar building-automation devices. Occasionally, however, applications will need to transfer larger payloads -- for instance, for firmware updates. With HTTP, TCP does the grunt work of slicing large payloads up into multiple packets and ensuring that they all arrive and are handled in the right order. CoAP is based on datagram transports such as UDP or DTLS, which limits the maximum size of resource representations that can be transferred without too much fragmentation. Although UDP supports larger payloads through IP fragmentation, it is limited to 64 KiB and, more importantly, doesn&#39;t really work well for constrained applications and networks. Instead of relying on IP fragmentation, this specification extends basic CoAP with a pair of &quot;Block&quot; options, for transferring multiple blocks of information from a resource representation in multiple request-response pairs. In many important cases, the Block options enable a server to be truly stateless: the server can handle each block transfer separately, with no need for a connection setup or other server-side memory of previous block transfers. In summary, the Block options provide a minimal way to transfer larger representations in a block-wise fashion.},
