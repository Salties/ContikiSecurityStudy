\chapter{Application Detection} \label{Chp: Appdetect}
Similar to website fingerprinting, we try to identify the application running on target note by its traffic. This chapter discusses some general idea without a specific application.

\section{Network Protocol Headers}
Since most contents of MAC\footnote{Media Access Control, not to be confused with the cryptographic term Message Authenticate Code.}, IP and UDP headers are related to routing and network maintenance, they are independent to the application data except length fields and CRC\footnote{Cyclic Redundancy Check, a code to detect or correct transmission error}. 

\section{Packet Length}
Packet length is usually the most interested target in traffic analysis. Packet lengths are also highly application dependant; thus we are not pursuing this topic further without a specific application.

\section{Timing Packet Response Intervals}
Unlike web applications where the client and server are usually physically distant, sensor networks can sometimes located in a concentrated area, such as a smart house which its radius can be less than 10 meters. 

These features theoretically enables one to capture all traffics in such a sensor network. As opposed to the case of Internet where packets are usually timed on the clientâ€™s side and thus network latency (RTT\footnote{Round-Trip Time}) must be concerned, being able to capture all traffic in the network provides  much more accurate timing information and hence may be exploited to develop more efficient attacks.

\begin{definition}
In a Request-Response application model, \textbf{RI}, {\bf Response Interval}, is defined as the interval between a request packet being received and its response being sent.
\end{definition}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Time (ms) & From (ID) & To (ID) & Length (bytes) & Type          \\ \hline
1961218   & 1         & 2       & 108            & ICMP ECHO \\ \hline
1961222   & 2         & 1       & 5              & 802.15.4 ACK  \\ \hline
1961230   & 2         & 1       & 107            & ICMP ECHO \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Packet Features of an ICMP ECHO request and response}
\label{Tbl: ping}
\end{table}

Three packets are marked out in \Cref{fig: ping packet} which forms an instance of ICMP ECHO\cite{rfc1122} (also known as PING) session. The extracted packet features are displayed in \Cref{Tbl: ping}.

\begin{description}
\item[Explanation of the Packets:]\hfill \\
The first packet is an ICMP ECHO request and the third packet being its response. The second packet is a 802.15.4 ACK\footnote{This is an acknowledgement from the receiver that notifies the sender that the packet has been received.} and is thus transparent to the upper ICMP protocol.
\end{description}

From this example we can see that the RI for this PING session is:
\begin{equation*}
1961230 - 1961218 = 12 \text{(ms)}
\end{equation*}

\end{example}

Timing information can be exploited by several attacks, such as \cite{Peekaboo} and \cite{rsatiming}.

We have experimentally measured a RNG\footnote{Random Number Generator. In Contiki OS, this corresponds to the library function random\_rand().} call on Wismote platform in the Cooja simulator that is roughly 0.03 ms.
