\chapter{Introduction}
This paper discusses two security measurements, namely Link Layer Security (LLSEC) and Datagram TLS (DTLS), within Contiki OS.

\section{Related Work}
\cite{802154Sec} discusses some security concerns in 802.15.4.  LLSEC\cite{LLSEC} is the implementation of 802.15.4 security in Contiki.

tinydtls\cite{tinydtls} is the implementation of DTLS we used in DTLS related experiments.

\section{Experiment Setup}
All experiments are done within the Cooja simulator.

The setup is as described in \Cref{fig: Setup}.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Adversary} is the malicious party that tries to recover information from the encrypted traffic.
\item{\bf Border Router}, or BR, is a device that connects the adversary to the sensor network. However, \textbf{BR is not allowed when LLSEC is enabled} as the adversary does not have the key and hence cannot connect into the network. 
\item{\bf Sniffer} is a device that passively captures all traffics in the sensor network. 
\item{\bf Target} and {\bf Nodes} are sensors deployed in the sensor network. They communicates to each other through encrypted channels.
\item{\bf Sensor Network} discussed in this paper is a 6LowPAN network.
\end{itemize}

\section{Adversary Power}

The powers assumed in the experiments are considered to be practical in real life.

When LLSEC is enabled, all traffic, including RPL\footnote{Routing Procol for Low-power and Lossy Networks} messages, are encrypted; therefore no external nodes can connect to the network. The only power for the adversary is to passively sniff all the traffic.

In other cases where LLSEC is disabled, the adversary will be  enabled to join the sensor network through a BR and hence is also capable to send ICMP messages to the target(s).
