\chapter{Introduction}
This paper discusses two security measurements, namely Link Layer Security (LLSEC) and Datagram TLS (DTLS), within Contiki OS.

\section{Related Work}
\cite{802154Sec} discusses some security concerns in 802.15.4.  LLSEC\cite{LLSEC} is the implementation of 802.15.4 security in Contiki.

tinydtls\cite{tinydtls} is the implementation of DTLS we used in the experiments.

\section{Experiment Setup}
All experiments are done within the Cooja simulator.
