\chapter{Introduction}
Contiki OS is an embedded system that used to build WSN\footnote{Wireless Sensor Network} based on 802.15.4\cite{802154} compatible devices and 6LowPAN\cite{rfc4944}. This paper discusses two security measurements, namely Link Layer Security (LLSEC) and Datagram TLS (DTLS), within Contiki OS. We also discuss some potential methods of fingerprinting an application running on a sensor node.

In \Cref{Chp: LLSEC} we describes a LLSEC implementation in Contiki OS called \textit{noncoresec} and argues that it does not met certain cryptographic security notions.

\Cref{Chp: DTLS} discusses some implementation issues of DTLS on Contiki OS.

\Cref{Chp: Appdetect} first argues that under some natures of WSN, an adversary could possibly collect more accurate timing information than usual Internet Web-application attacker. Then we describe a potential side-channel attack that fingerprints an application the target sensor node is running, using interactions between PING protocol and the application running on the target node.
